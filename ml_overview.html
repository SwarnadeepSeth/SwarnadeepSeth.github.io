                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                        Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In recent years, there have been many advances in ML techniques that have enabled the development of more sophisticated and accurate models. Here are some recent techniques of Machine Learning:. <br><br>
                                        <b>1. Deep Learning:</b> This is a type of ML that involves the use of artificial neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns in data. Deep learning has been used for a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games like chess and Go.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>2. Transfer Learning:</b> This technique involves using pre-trained models on one task to improve the performance on a related but different task. Transfer learning has been widely used in computer vision and natural language processing.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>3. Reinforcement Learning:</b> This is a type of ML where an agent learns to interact with an environment by taking actions and receiving rewards or punishments. Reinforcement learning has been used for tasks such as game playing, robotics, and optimization problems.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>4. AutoML:</b> This is an approach to ML that involves automating the process of selecting the best algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature engineering techniques for a given dataset. AutoML has been used to speed up the process of developing ML models and to reduce the need for human expertise.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</b> This is a type of deep learning model that consists of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates samples that are similar to the training data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. GANs have been used for tasks such as generating realistic images, videos, and music.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>6. Federated Learning:</b> This is a technique that involves training ML models on distributed devices without exchanging data. Federated learning has been used for privacy-sensitive applications such as medical diagnosis and personalization.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>7. Attention Mechanisms:</b> This is a technique that allows ML models to selectively focus on different parts of the input data. Attention mechanisms have been used to improve the performance of models in natural language processing and computer vision.
                                        <br><br>
                                        These are just a few examples of recent techniques of Machine Learning. As the field continues to evolve, new techniques are likely to emerge, leading to even more powerful and sophisticated ML models.
